## About

BloodShot is a fast-paced action game where your ammunition is your life. Every shot you fire costs you health, forcing you to make tactical decisions in the heat of battle. Hunt down enemies, collect their souls to restore your vitality, and survive as long as you can.

## How to Play

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **WASD** | Move your character |
| **Mouse** | Aim |
| **Left Click** | Shoot (costs health!) |
| **ESC** | Pause game |

## Core Mechanic

Each shot you fire **costs you health**. This creates a unique risk-reward gameplay loop:

- **Shooting drains your life** - Every bullet fired takes away your health
- **Collect souls** - Defeated enemies drop souls that restore your life
- **Aim carefully** - Aimless firing leads to death
- **Balance aggression with survival** - Know when to fight and when to conserve
